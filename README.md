# Student Project List

Students in the Code Fellows Foundations 1 class requested a way to see what projects other students were building. This app collects basic info on projects for easy sharing.

## Rails Demo

In the last 7 minutes of class, this app was spec'd, build, and deployed, using Ruby on Rails.

You can see it live [on Heroku](http://cf-c14-projects.herokuapp.com/projects).
